    "The objective of my project was to create a chatbot by using some of the tools we worked on in the A3 assignment, and adding new functionalities to make it specialize in giving information about movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot has functionalities that allow it to suggest random movies to watch, list some popular movie titles and give information about a number of movies about their IMDB rating, plot description and the year they were released. It can also give an opinion about those movies and whether or not it recommends them to the person talking to the chatbot. \n",

    "These are accomplished with a number of functions that are executed if some keywords such as \"information\",\"list\" or \"quit' are present in the input that's typed in the chatbox. If those keywords are present, the relevant function is executed and if the keywords aren't present then the program returns a random answer."
